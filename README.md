### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, 22, Intern in a big French datascience consulting group. 

I love hacking some personal projects and being up to date on the latest technos.

## On-going projects:
 - ðŸ“± **Memories (name not definitive)** : a new social media made using Expo and Serverless Stack
 - ðŸ•¹ thrillex : a 3D game made in Java using my ECS, pECS. The ECS helped implement the physic and the OpenGL rendering system

## Cool "finished" projects:
 - pECS : a very simple **E**ntity **C**omponent **S**ystem made in Java
 - Polimi GUI Pipeline : a toolbox made to help newbies use very advance AI models without coding
 - Minecraft JS : a clone of the Minecraft rendering system (and art)

## All time top 3 techs : 
 - Serverless Stack
 - Expo
 - React
