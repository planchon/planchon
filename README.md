### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work at Stratumn on an AI based workflow orchestration engine. On my free time i love to experiment on my ideas, i want to challenge myself, creating project where there are a lot of unknown unknown  : 
- **Brume** : a new kind of orchestration engine, based on bidding and polling. Written in Go using Temporal
- **Voxel** : a voxel engine based on raytracing, ecs and rust
